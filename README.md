# BTC Unbound

A bitcoin dca bot, that buys bitcoin with eur at regular intervals.
Pretty crude atm, but does the job well enough for me.

## Plans

For now, the only thing I'm interested in having working properly is a DCA bot.
I might consider implementing a few buy/sell signals, although I'm not sure about the profitability of any algo trading strategy.

## Installation

```
npm run install
```

## Configuring

Create a .env file in the root folder of the project with the variables:
- KRAKEN_API_KEY
- KRAKEN_API_SECRET

## Running

```
npm run start
```
